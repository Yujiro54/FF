        <h1>1999 Nissan Skyline GT-R R34</h1>
        <p>The Nissan Skylines produced for the film were all R34s (the model itself was introduced back in 1998). The R34s in the films were powered by an RB26DETT 2.6-liter, DOHC, 24-valve straight six sitting longitudinally in the engine bay that's force fed by twin turbos and officially rated at 280 hp. The R34's engine feeds a six-speed Getrag gearbox that in turn sends power to the ATTESA all-wheel-drive system, which electronically varies the torque split.</p>  
        <p>2 Fast 2 Furious
        Brian uses his Nissan Skyline to participate in the street race hosted by Tej Parker. He races against the likes of his friend Suki, and opponents Slap Jack and Orange Julius. 
        Slap Jack's 1993 Toyota Supra competes against the Skyline successfully until he makes too wide a turn, allowing Brian to take the lead.

        <h1>1994 Toyota Supra MK IV</h1>
        <p>The 1994 Toyota Supra Mk 4 from the original "The Fast and Furious" film stands out as the car that brought the spotlight to the street tuner scene. <p>In the film, the Supra started out as a pile of scrap that Dominic Toretto and his team had to rebuild, which would later become the striking "ten-second car" immortalized in pop culture today. While the Supra certainly had its moments in both the first film and its sequel, its real-life counterpart had just as much impact outside the silver screen. In 2021, one of the Supra Mk 4 stunt cars featured in the films</p>
        was sold at Barret-Jackson's car auctions for over half a million dollars.</p>

        <h1>1970 Dodge Charger R/T</h1>
        <p>The 1970 Dodge Charger R/T was kept inside the garage of the Toretto House, was built by Dominic and his father in his youth. When his father was killed in a stock race accident by Kenny Linder, Dominic refused to drive the Charger because he was afraid of it.</p>
        <p>When Brian O'Conner became integrated into the crew and even began dating Dominic's sister, Mia Toretto, Dominic led him to the garage and showed him the Charger. 
        The car is famed for its incredible power at 900 horsepower and holding a record 1/4 mile time at just nine seconds flat, set by Dom's father at the Los Angeles County Raceway.</p>

        <h1>1995 Mitsubishi Eclipse</h1>
        <p>The 1995 Mitsubishi Eclipse has 420a 16-valve dual overhead cam 2-Liter 4-cylinder engine rated at 165hp before turbo. It has a full Robo Car Aero Armor Eclipse Body Kit, custom made carbon fiber front splitter, a custom GT style roof scoop, a APR two level GT2 style wing, carbon fiber mirrors, 1997 spec Eclipse headlights, and green neon lighting, alongside SE7EN 18-inch wheels by Axis Sport Tuning Inc. in 225/40ZR18 Toyo Tires.</p>
        <p>Under the alias, "Brian Earl Spilner", Brian O'Conner used the Eclipse in preparation for his first street race. He practices driving in the Eclipse at the parking lot at Dodger Stadium, but can't keep the car from spinning out of control. Despite complications experienced earlier, Brian decided to participate in the street race to win the favor of Dominic Toretto.</p>
        <p>During the race, the Eclipse's intake manifold began to overheat from an overcompensation of NOS used in the vehicle. Brian ignored the warnings and continued to use the NOS until the car began to fall apart. He managed to beat Edwin, but eventually lost control of the car. He lost to Dominic, who won the race and the pink slip to Eclipse.</p>

        <h1>Flip Cars</h1>
        <p>An increasing number of nearly ground-up or completely custom machines are featured in the later Fast and Furious movies, but none have the cool factor of the flip cars. In concept, these are open-wheel race cars built like tanks, and they did indeed have the real-life capability to </p>
        <p>flip incoming vehicles out of their way. In canon the flip cars had turbodiesel engines and sequential transmissions, but in real life they were powered by the same highly reliable LS3s powering most F&F cars.</p>
